# Smoke-Detection-Project
A smoke detector is basically a device which detects smoke and raises an alarm to alert others. 
They are mostly used in offices, home, factories, etc.

The objective of this project is to make an AI model using the given dataset to accurately raise an alarm if smoke is detected.

Data Understanding - The data provided is in a csv file format, containing various physicochemical properties of fire. Exploratory analysis will be carried out in the notebook before modelling.
Data Preparation - There are no null values in the dataset
Modelling - 5 models will be evaluated for this classification task: logistic regression, random forest, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine and decision tree. Training and test data was split 70:30.
Evaluation - Each of the 5 models will be compared and evaluated using Cross validation, precision and recall.
Deployment - This was not within the scope of this exercise
